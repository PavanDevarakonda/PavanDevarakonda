## 💡 About Me

I'm a data-driven technologist with 3+ years of experience working on real-world healthcare and AI problems. Currently pursuing my Master's in Data Analytics at **San Jose State University**, I specialize in designing and deploying intelligent systems using **LLMs**, **MLOps**, and **cloud-native architectures**.

From deploying HIPAA-compliant pipelines to building multimodal retrieval systems and agentic AI assistants, I enjoy solving complex problems with scalable, production-grade solutions.
